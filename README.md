# CodeProjects
This is a sample of coding projects I have done in my classes that I have taken at Rutgers. Many of these have their foundations constructed by professors and their teaching assistants such that students like my self have to simply create the code for the program to run. I feel that they show my knowledge and skills relatively and that I am very willing to learn more.
A lot of these used libraries and other input files, but overall I feel they showcase my abilities.
